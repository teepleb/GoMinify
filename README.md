# GoMinify
A simple minification program to minify JS, CSS, HTML, and frontend PHP files prior to being deployed to production.

Plan is to build the minification process and then turn it into an executable/CLI script for devs to use at my current work place.


*Note: This is not stable and currently in development, I would suggest not using in a production environment.*
